	<h2>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? (Sonnet 18)</h2>
	<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br />Thou art more temperate<br />Rough wind do shake the darling buds of May,<br />And summer's lease hath all too short a date<br /></p>
	<div>
	<p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shine,<br />And often is his gold complextion dimmed;<br />And every fair from fair some time declines,</p>
	</div>
	<div>
	<p>By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;<br />But thy eternal summer shall not face,<br />Nor lose possession of that fair thou aw'st,<br />Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, </p>
	</div>
	<div>
	<p>When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.<br />So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see<br />So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
