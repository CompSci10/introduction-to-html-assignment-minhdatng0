		<h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? (Sonnet 18)</h1>
		<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br />Thou art more temperate<br />Rough wind do shake the darling buds of May,<br />And summer's lease hath all too short a date<br /></p>
		<p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shine,<br />And often is his gold complextion dimmed;<br />And every fair from fair some time declines,</p>
		<p>By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;<br />But thy eternal summer shall not face,<br />Nor lose possession of that fair thou aw'st,<br />Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, </p>
		<p></p>
